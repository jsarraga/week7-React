## Stock Lookup Part II

#### React Stock Lookup

Create a webpage that has an `input` element and a `Submit` button. The `input` element should take in a stock ticker symbol from the user, and the `submit` button should:

* Look up the ticker symbol on either IEX Cloud or the MarkIt API

* Render a `Stock` component that shows Company Name, Ticker Symbol, Opening Price, Trade Volume, and Current/Latest Price

You do not need error handling for case.
